# Wikipedia genealogical tree

## Following steps

- Getting character info when the user clicks it (leaf nodes)
- working in styles
- todos on character-box component
- left menu with the characters and search bar to improve UX
- saving most searched characters on db

## What I'm using on this project

- DOM manipulation with the input from the Wikipedia API
- Nested promises using the ancestors of a character
- Svelte stores saving the tree of the character on it
- Svelte routes
- Javascript classes
- Recursive calling drawing the character nodes with svelte:self
